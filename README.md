## ⚙️ What Is a Triggerbot in Insurgency: Sandstorm?

A **triggerbot** is a cheat that automatically fires your weapon the moment your crosshair lands on a valid enemy target. No clicks, no hesitation—just instant shots the second an opponent walks into your sightline.

Perfect for:

* ⚡ **Snipers holding pixel angles**
* 🚪 **CQB players pre-aiming corners**
* 🔭 **Riflers watching long sightlines**
* 🔫 **Hipfire players pushing tight hallways**

The triggerbot feels like having the world’s fastest reflexes—and it works on any gun.

## 🧠 Key Features of the Sandstorm Triggerbot

🎯 **Auto Fire on Crosshair Contact** – No manual click needed. Just aim, and it shoots.

🔒 **Enemy Detection Only** – Doesn’t fire on teammates, AI civilians, or empty space.

🧩 **Configurable Delay** – Add slight human-like reaction time (in ms) to avoid suspicion.

📏 **Bone Priority Scan** – Fires only when crosshair aligns with head, chest, or full hitbox.

🕵️ **Visibility Checks** – Won’t fire if target is behind smoke, walls, or blocked angles.

🎮 **Hold-Key Mode** – Enable triggerbot only while holding a specific button (like ALT or SHIFT).

👻 **Silent Assist Option** – Fire without changing crosshair color or triggering overlays.

## 🔥 Why Triggerbot Hits Harder in Sandstorm

Unlike casual shooters, **Insurgency: Sandstorm is ultra-lethal**. One tap kills are the norm, not the exception. That makes the triggerbot *especially deadly* in this game.

* 🧠 No need to panic-click during surprise peeks
* 💥 Instant return fire before your enemy even pulls the trigger
* 🧼 Looks legit if paired with normal movement and clean crosshair placement
* 🎯 Invaluable in sniper overwatch roles and co-op with hardened bots

Pair this with a smooth aimbot or wallhack, and you're literally untouchable in every lobby.

## 🛠️ How To Set It Up

1. **Disable antivirus & firewall** – Triggerbot may be flagged as a macro tool or cheat layer.
2. **Run loader as admin** – Most tools require elevated access to inject properly.
3. **Inject before launching the game or mid-lobby**
4. **Press Insert to open menu** – Toggle triggerbot ON.
5. **Set your keybind, delay (ms), and hitbox target**
6. **Go test it in co-op or casual mode** before jumping into PvP ranked.

Stay subtle with delay timers and don’t use it on every shot if you’re trying to go undetected.
